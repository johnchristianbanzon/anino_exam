Notes:
- DID NOT INCLUDE FIREBASE IN PROJECT REPOSITORY, PLEASE PREPARE CONFIG BEFOREHAND.


Main Core architecture:
- using DI (IoC) principle with zenject framework (https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject)

Points of interest:
- Scalability  : With the classes injected it would be easier and more cleaner to update or add new code as well as add new functionalities.
- Flexibility  : App has some flexibility thanks to the firebase config.
- MVC : With the usage of DI it is more easier to connect model and view even without a controller as DI will only inject if needed and will be able to use interface to further optimize access modifiers.


Points for improvement:
*App
- Wonky animation, needed some more time for tweaking
- Scatter function (wanted)
- Improvement in spinning

Code
- Incomplete code architecture
- Pop up systems
- Too many temp
- Points of refactor
